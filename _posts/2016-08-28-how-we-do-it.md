## How we do it

We offer a talented network pool of experienced resource to agencies and companies who want help but don't have the need, capacity or budget for additional full-time staff.

As a resource provider, we can work on site or remotely to agreed hours / days.

We're available daily to take a call, answer emails, be in the office, or to attend project and or client meetings, as required.

With access to a huge network, we come in and deliver projects when you either can't, due to insufficient time or capacity or perhaps, when you don't have the required skills in-house. Working either remotely, in-house or a combination of the two, let us look after your key deliverables, combat issues and keep your critical path and project on-track to the highest high standards.

We know how to get the job done well. We're flexible. Use The Production Exchange and it will feel like you have a full time resource, minus the messy obligations. No extra PAYE, no greater commitment, no extra worries with all the benefits of having an extremely competent and experienced member/s of staff.
